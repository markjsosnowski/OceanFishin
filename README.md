A Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV.

This repository is for development of the plugin! If you just want to use this addon, you'll need to install the [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) and read the 
[FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/dalamud_troubleshooting.html#q-how-do-i-installenable-plugins).

Ocean Fishin' is currently only availble as testing plugin. See [the FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/dalamud_troubleshooting.html#q-how-do-i-enable-plugin-test-builds) for how to install testing plugins. 

## How to Use
`/oceanfishing` or `/fishin` to open the plugin window.

## Features
While in the ocean fishing duty, this plugin suggests bait to use...
* to catch fish that may trigger the spectral current.
* when you have the Fisher's Intuition buff.
* during the spectral current for fish worth a lot of points.
* to catch the exceptionally rare spectral intuition fish.
* for certain types of achievement and mission fish.

Outside of the duty, the window will show you a timer counting down until the next voyage.
